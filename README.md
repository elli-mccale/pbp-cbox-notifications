# Cbox Notifications
A plugin built with the free forum software [ProBoards](https://proboards.com/) that hides a Cbox behind a dialog window, and shows a notification on the trigger button when a new message has been posted.

To test that the plugin is working correctly: duplicate your browser tab, open the dialog from one tab, and send a message. You should see the notification appear over the trigger button in the other tab.

## Installation
1. Download the [cbox-notifications.pbp](cbox-notifications.pbp) file and save it somewhere easily accessible, such as your Desktop or Downloads folder
2. Go to your forum's Admin Panel
3. Click on **Plugins > Manage**
4. Click the "Import Plugin" button
5. Click the "Choose Plugin File" button
6. Navigate to and select the cbox-notifications.pbp file
7. Once the plugin has been imported, click the "Finished" button near the bottom right of the modal dialog window

**NOTE:**
> You will be required to provide a unique URL before the plugin can be enabled.
